       "\"React Clean Code Clean code is more than just working code.<eos><eos> Clean code is easy to read, simple to understand, and neatly organized.<eos><eos> In this article, we’ll look at eight ways we can write cleaner React code.<eos><eos> When going through these suggestions, it’s important to remember that’s exactly what they are: suggestions.<eos><eos> If you disagree with any of them, that’s completely fine.<eos><eos> However, these are practices that I’ve found helpful in writing my own React code.<eos><eos> Let’s dive in!<eos><eos> 1.<eos><eos> Conditional Rendering Only for One Condition If you need to conditionally render something when a condition is true and not render anything when a condition is false, don’t use a ternary operator.<eos><eos> Use the && operator instead.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: 2.<eos><eos> Conditional Rendering on Either Condition If you need to conditionally render one thing when a condition is true and render a different thing when the condition is false, use a ternary operator.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: 3.<eos><eos> Boolean Props A truthy prop can be provided to a component with just the prop name without a value like this: myTruthyProp.<eos><eos> Writing it like myTruthyProp={true} is unnecessary.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: 4.<eos><eos> String Props A string prop value can be provided in double-quotes without the use of curly braces or backticks.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: 5.<eos><eos> Event Handler Functions If an event handler only takes a single argument for the Event object, you can just provide the function as the event handler like this: onChange={handleChange}.<eos><eos> You don't need to wrap the function in an anonymous function like this: onChange={e => handleChange(e)}.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: 6.<eos><eos> Passing Components As Props When passing a component as a prop to another component, you don’t need to wrap this passed component in a function if the component does not accept any props.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: 7.<eos><eos> Undefined Props Undefined props are excluded, so don’t worry about providing an undefined fallback if it's OK for the prop to be undefined.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: 8.<eos><eos> Setting State That Relies on the Previous State Always set state as a function of the previous state if the new state relies on the previous state.<eos><eos> React state updates can be batched, and not writing your updates this way can lead to unexpected results.<eos><eos> Bad example: Good example: Honorable Mentions The following practices are not React-specific but rather good practices for writing clean code in JavaScript (or any programming language, for that matter).<eos><eos> Happy coding!<eos><eos> Advice for programmers.<eos><eos> 1.<eos><eos>1K  14  A weekly newsletter sent every Friday with the best articles we published that week.<eos><eos> Code tutorials, advice, career opportunities, and more!<eos><eos>\\xa0Take a look.<eos><eos>  By signing up, you will create a Medium account if you don’t already have one.<eos><eos> Review our Privacy Policy for more information about our privacy practices.<eos><eos> Check your inboxMedium sent you an email at  to complete your subscription.<eos><eos> Thanks to Anupam Chugh.<eos><eos>\\xa0 1.<eos><eos>1K\\xa0claps 1.<eos><eos>1K\\xa0claps 14 responses Written by Senior software engineer.<eos><eos> Continuous learner.<eos><eos> Educator.<eos><eos> http://tylerhawkins.<eos><eos>info Advice for programmers.<eos><eos> Written by Senior software engineer.<eos><eos> Continuous learner.<eos><eos> Educator.<eos><eos> http://tylerhawkins.<eos><eos>info Advice for programmers.<eos><eos> Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking.<eos><eos> Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive into the heart of any topic and bring new ideas to the surface.<eos><eos> Learn more Follow the writers, publications, and topics that matter to you, and you’ll see them on your homepage and in your inbox.<eos><eos> Explore If you have a story to tell, knowledge to share, or a perspective to offer — welcome home.<eos><eos> It’s easy and free to post your thinking on any topic.<eos><eos> Write on Medium About Help Legal Get the Medium app\""
